## Project Kanban

## Project Description
The goal of this team project is to reproduce a simplified version of the classic strategy
game RISK. If you don’t know the game, you can play “RISK: Global Domination” as a
free download from Steam. The Map and the rules can also be found on Wikipedia.
We will skip the initial phase where players normally take turns placing armies on
countries, and instead we will start with a random allocation of armies. This corresponds
to the “auto” setup in “RISK: Global Domination”.
We will also skip the phase of drawing cards and using them to receive more armies.
But for the rest we will stick with the official rules, and the official Map and countries.
The number of players ranges from 2 to 6, and the corresponding initial number of armies
is 50, 35, 30, 25, and 20 respectively, depending on the number of players.
The project is divided into 4 iterations, each ending with a milestone corresponding to
deliverables that will be graded. You will be able to use the TA feedback from iteration i
for iteration i+1. 

## Project Milestone 1: (Friday Oct 23rd)

A text-based playable version of the game, i.e., players should be able to
play the game via the console using the keyboard. There should be a command to print
the state of the Map (i.e., which player is in which country and with how many armies), a
command to decide which country to attack from which country, and a command to pass
your turn to the next player. Events such as the outcome of an attack, whose turn it is to
play, the elimination of a player, etc. should be printed to the console when applicable.
Also required, the UML modeling of the problem domain (class diagrams with complete
variable and method signatures, and sequence diagrams for important scenarios), detailed
description of the choice of data structures and relevant operations: you are providing an
initial design and implementation for the Model part of the MVC. Do not worry about
any GUI yet.
Deliverables: readme file + code (source + executable in a jar file) + UML diagrams + documentation, all in one zip file.
